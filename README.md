REDOING THIS AGAIN. SERIOUS BUGS ARE OCCURRING WITHOUT ANY SOLUTIONS TO BE MADE NOR FOUND. 
  RE: BUG HAS BEEN FOUND AND FIXED!
MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS PROJECT HAS PROVEN VERY DIFFICULT DURING AP EXAM SEASON. HOWEVER, I DID LEARN MORE ABOUT SQL AND LEARNED SOME HMTL IN HOPES OF CREATING A GUI AFTER CREATING A MORE FUNCTIONAL BANKING SYSTEM. IF THIS PROJECT WERE TAKEN PLACE EARLIER OR LATER WITHIN THE YEAR -NOT AROUND FINALS- PROGRESSION WOULD BE MORE VIABLE AND FUNCTIONAL. I'LL MOST LIKELY WORK ON THIS AS A SIDE PROJECT IN THE FUTURE TO SEE HOW COMPLEX I CAN MAKE IT WITH EXTRA TIME TO SPARE.
